Back to delve into the science around birth control. If you\u2019ve been around the sub longer than 2 days, you have probably seen a post or two go something like this:\n\nOP: I tried birth control, and it was awful....\n\nMod: Which one?\n\nWe ask this question so often that many of our top commenters have started asking it too. Which one?\n\nMany folks treat birth control as if it were a monolith, and my personal opinion of why this happens is that we use the term \u2018birth control\u2019, which is an outcome. Many medications are categorized based on their mechanism of action: Beta2-adrenergic Agonist, GLP-1 Agonist, PDE5 Inhibitor, Direct Xa Inhibitor, etc., and yet contraceptives are named for just 1 of their many outcomes. Some medications have evolved from their category names; for example, antidepressants have been replaced with terminology like SSRIs and SNRIs that are more specific in their mechanism of action, and yet, after decades of use, we still call it birth control. And I hate it. (I do understand why the original term was used in the [context of that time's feminist movement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_birth_control))\n\nWhen we say \u2018birth control,\u2019 we erase the fact that these drugs act on multiple neuroendocrine axes, and that erasure makes both patients and clinicians worse at predicting side effects, especially in hormonally sensitive brains. There are the obvious differences in birth control like patches, implants, pills, etc., but this isn\u2019t where the issues derive from.\n\nHormonal contraceptives work by suppressing the body\u2019s own hormone production at the brain and ovary signaling level and replacing it with synthetic hormones that communicate with steroid receptors throughout the brain and body. More specifically, it acts on the HPG axis and on estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and other steroid receptors (GR &amp; AR).\n\nYour HPG-axis is comprised of the hypothalamus (part of your brain), pituitary (part of your brain), and gonads (organs that produce eggs or sperm). In those with female sex organs, the gonads are the ovaries, so the term HPO axis is used to provide further specificity.\n\nIf you read [last week\u2019s post on HPA-axis dysregulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1qc37kk/why_stress_hits_harder_with_pmdd_hpaaxis/), this is where you might pause and think that two of these letters seem very familiar. The 'H' &amp; 'P' involved in HPA-axis dysregulation are the very same 2 organs that are fully or partially suppressed by birth control. This kind of overlap between hormone systems is called neuroendocrine crosstalk.\n\nBecause the hypothalamus and pituitary also help regulate cortisol through the HPA axis, medications that change HPO-axis signaling can also change how sensitive the body is to stress and how strongly it reacts to stress. This matters for people with PMDD, even if they do not have HPA-axis dysregulation.\n\nIf we were to rename them, we would sub-categorize them as something like:\n\n1. Full HPO-axis suppressants\n2. Partial HPO-axis suppressants\n3. Non-HPO-axis contraceptives\n\nA full HPO-axis suppressant contains both estradiol and a progestin. Together, these hormones signal the brain to stop sending messages to the ovaries, which lowers the release of key hormones needed for ovulation. This effectively shuts down the body\u2019s ovarian hormone cycle and prevents ovulation. In addition to stopping ovulation, these hormones also send signals to the brain, the stress system, and many tissues throughout the body, which is why their effects are not limited to reproduction. *This full suppression is why these are recommended for those who have PMDD.*\n\nA partial HPO-axis suppressant contains only a progestin. It sends signals that lower the hormone needed to trigger ovulation, which can weaken or sometimes stop ovulation. However, the ovaries often continue to produce some estrogen, at varying levels.\n\n[From our AMA with Drs. Eisenlohr-Moul and Peters.](https://preview.redd.it/gbg4epnu4leg1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab119a490abda2eb1bfb0acfc1aa83ba93a15a79)\n\nNon-HPO-axis contraceptives do not involve hormones and do not act on central endocrine signaling; they most often work through mechanical or local means to prevent conception (condoms, diaphragms, vaginal gels, etc.). *The lack of activity on the neuroendocrine system is why these neither help nor hurt those who have PMDD.*\n\nSince its introduction, the birth control pill has used ethinyl estradiol (EE) as its synthetic estrogen; there are a few newer formulations, like Nextstellis, that have begun to use other synthetic estrogens, but for the most part, EE is the tried and true in combined formulations. Therefore, for most formulations, the progestins are the source of variations in receptor communication. A given progestin is formulated to dial up or down the volume at which it speaks to receptors; some are designed to talk very loudly to your estrogen receptors and only whisper to your progesterone receptors. Others tell your androgen receptors to zip it and be quiet, while letting your glucocorticoid receptors be heard. This\u00a0communication can create a positive impact, like less anxiety, but it is also where side effects come from:\n\n* Higher androgenic activity increases the chances of side effects like acne and unwanted hair growth \n* Higher estrogenic activity increases the chances of side effects like breast fullness and heavier periods \n* Higher progestogenic activity increases the chances of side effects like mood changes, fatigue, depression, and weight gain \n* Antimineralocorticoid activity decreases side effects like water retention and bloating\n\n[We Have a Table in our Wiki that Covers Which Receptors the Most Common Progestins Act On and The 3 Rules for Selecting a Birth Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/wiki/index/birth_control/)\n\nWhile a pill like Yaz (24/4 drospirenone &amp; EE ) is the frequently used starting point for PMDD, when a physician is selecting a birth control for you, they are often balancing finding a formula that works for your PMDD + if you have PME of an underlying disorder + if you have HPA-axis dysregulation + if you have other health conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or migraine with aura.

Symptom patterns derived from your tracking will help them determine themes like whether you have more anxiety or more depressive symptoms. Are you suffering from cycles of insomnia and/or hypersomnia? Does unexpected stress cause your symptoms to flare? Daily symptom tracking after you start it will help them fine-tune what is working and what is not. *I personally have a lot more anxiety than depression in my symptom patterns. I benefited from the greater amount of EE found in Yasmin compared to that in Yaz.*\n\nIf you have done the above and are struggling to find an answer, there are other specialties you can tap into. Reproductive Endocrinologists (RE), particularly those associated with academic medical centers, are knowledgeable in treating cross-axis disorders. Molecular Psychiatrists are knowledgeable about accounting for gene variants such as [MAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A) and [COMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechol-O-methyltransferase) that impact medication metabolism. Pharmacists are the unsung heroes who are often underutilized for their incredible knowledge of how medications affect the body and how the body affects medications.\n\n\\--\n\nWhen I am doing lived-experience chats within the PMDD community, I often share how improperly prescribed hormonal contraception once made me a safety risk to myself and my newborn child.\n\nI was not uninformed. I had a PMDD diagnosis that was more than a decade old. I understood the research. I knew my own symptom patterns. PMDD was documented in my chart, and my provider was aware of it. I was not na\u00efve.\n\nI was also postpartum, exhausted, and, because paternity laws suck, alone at my 6-week follow-up, running on fumes. Breastfeeding was helping keep my PMDD quiet, so I wanted to do it for as long as possible. I was prescribed a progestin-only pill because that was the standard of care. I did not question it because I did not have the physical or cognitive bandwidth to challenge a default recommendation in that moment. I trusted that a clinician who knew my diagnosis was accounting for it.\n\nWithin days, I became a mess.\n\nMy husband came home from work one evening and found me sitting on the nursery floor. I remember telling him, \u2018I\u2019m not okay,\u2019 and that he could not leave me alone or leave me alone with the baby. I had enough PMDD cycles under my belt to know that even though I wasn\u2019t having a period, something was very wrong. We went through what had changed, and the only variable was the birth control. I stopped taking it, and within days, I began to improve.\n\nWhen I went back, she gave me a hormonal IUD. Mirena, if you\u2019re curious.\n\nIt felt like going from the frying pan directly into the fire. I do not use the word *unhinged* lightly, but that is the only word that fits. I had it removed as soon as I could and swore off hormonal birth control entirely for the next 4 years. At the time, I did not yet have the language to ask why I was being given a partial HPO-axis suppressant with high progestogenic and androgenic activity despite a documented PMDD diagnosis. I asked, \u201cWill this one work differently?\u2019\n\nIf this has happened to you, you are most definitely not alone. When I tell this story live, I often tear up. I can tell who has PMDD in the crowd because they start nodding, or making that \u2018oh shit, I know how this is going to go' grimace, and I point out to the providers in the crowd that the universal reaction they are witnessing is why medication distrust is so common. I share this story not to scare people away from medication. I share it to highlight that even someone who knows the literature and understands PMDD can still be caught up in protocol-driven care.\n\nThat experience also made me swear \u2018never again\u2019 when it came to my care. After seeing an RE for some time to get myself sorted, I transferred to a different OB, who was willing to slow down, read the studies I brought him, and talk through the mechanisms.\n\nThe unfortunate reality of our healthcare system is that you often need to be your own safety net. When it comes to this disorder, you have to arm yourself with information and ask questions.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nBerni LC, Nunes LR, Oliveira RCS.

I can tell who has PMDD in the crowd because they start nodding, or making that \u2018oh shit, I know how this is going to go&amp;#39; grimace, and I point out to the providers in the crowd that the universal reaction they are witnessing is why medication distrust is so common. I share this story not to scare people away from medication. I share it to highlight that even someone who knows the literature and understands PMDD can still be caught up in protocol-driven care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That experience also made me swear \u2018never again\u2019 when it came to my care. After seeing an RE for some time to get myself sorted, I transferred to a different OB, who was willing to slow down, read the studies I brought him, and talk through the mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate reality of our healthcare system is that you often need to be your own safety net. When it comes to this disorder, you have to arm yourself with information and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Berni LC, Nunes LR, Oliveira RCS.
