      "message": "my head hurts most nights. it doesnt hurt that bad but i get really light sensitive and somewhat noise sensitive, and pretty dizzy.",
      "response": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing these symptoms. It sounds like your head discomfort is accompanied by light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, and dizziness, which can be quite challenging to deal with, especially at night. \n\nCan you tell me more about when these headaches typically start? For instance, do they occur after a long day, or do they seem to come on suddenly? Also, how long do they usually last? \n\nIt might also be helpful to explore any patterns or triggers you\u2019ve noticed. For example, do certain activities, foods, or stress levels seem to correlate with the onset of your symptoms? \n\nRemember, while I can help you reflect on your experiences, it\u2019s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if these symptoms persist or worsen. They can provide you with the support and guidance you need."
